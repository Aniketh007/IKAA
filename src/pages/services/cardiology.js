                A heart arrhythmia operation, medically known as cardiac electrophysiology, is a specialized procedure designed to treat irregular heart rhythms. It is performed by highly trained cardiac electrophysiologists who have expertise in diagnosing and managing heart arrhythmias. This procedure aims to restore the normal rhythm of the heart and ensure optimal cardiac function.
                <br/>
                Procedure Overview:
                <br/>
                1. Diagnosis: Before the operation, a thorough evaluation of the patient's heart rhythm is conducted using various diagnostic tests, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), Holter monitors, and electrophysiological studies (EPS). This helps identify the type and cause of the arrhythmia.
                <br/>
                2. Preparation: The patient is prepared for the procedure, which may involve fasting and discontinuing certain medications. An intravenous (IV) line is inserted to administer medications and fluids during the procedure.
                <br/>
                3. Anesthesia: Most heart arrhythmia operations are performed under local anesthesia with mild sedation, allowing the patient to remain conscious but relaxed. In some cases, general anesthesia may be used.
                <br/>
                4. Catheterization: Cardiac catheters are inserted through blood vessels, typically in the groin or arm, and threaded to the heart. These catheters are equipped with electrodes for mapping and ablating (treating) the arrhythmia.
                <br/>
                5. Mapping: The electrophysiologist maps the electrical signals within the heart to pinpoint the area causing the arrhythmia. This mapping helps guide the treatment.
                <br/>
                6. Ablation: Radiofrequency or cryoablation is performed to create lesions (scar tissue) on the heart tissue responsible for the abnormal electrical signals. This prevents the arrhythmia from occurring.
                <br/>
                7. Post-Procedure Evaluation: After the ablation is complete, the patient's heart rhythm is closely monitored to ensure the arrhythmia has been successfully treated. This may involve the use of temporary pacemakers.
